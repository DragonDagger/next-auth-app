# Learning how to use Next.js (App Router)

- Following this YouTube series: [Next.js Full Course on Auth](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRAV69dS1uWR7KF-zV6YPYtKYEHENETyE)
- The Auth side of things is not as important, as its not very secure with this basic youtube tutorial.
- _Mainly followed this to:_
  - figure out the latest App Router
  - making HTTP requests with Nextjs API routes
  - using axios instead of react fetch API on the client
  - connecting to a MongoDB database and posting data to it from the client-side form.

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

`npm run dev`
